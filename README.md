# GroupMenu
Tiny little ESO add-on to allow more information about the current group members to be shown in the group menu of the in-game user interface. The add-on adds the new user interface controls inside the existing elements, to avoid unnecessary creation of clutter. Requires the following libraries:
* LibStub
* LibAddonMenu-2.0
